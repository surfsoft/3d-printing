# 3D Printing

Here you'll find some 3D printing designs I've used around the house.
Some have been created to replace things that have broken and are not easily (or perhaps cheaply) replaced, like the show head mount or utility meter box key/latch set.
Others are just there to help keep things organised, like the knife block or cutlery drawer separators.

You are free to use these designs at your own risk, they are all licenced under Apache 2.0

All designs were put together using OpenSCAD. 
I've included both the STL files for printing, and the OpenSCAD files if you would like to modify the designs in any way.
I've used Cura to create the gcode printer files, but have not included these as they are printer specific.
