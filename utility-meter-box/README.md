# Utility box key and latch

These parts are for a utility box - typically the white plastic box that contains a gas meter.
There's a key, and a three part spindle and latch. 

The two spindle parts are joined with a 22mm piece of 3mm rod and some glue appropriate to the printer material used (cyanoacrilete - superglue - for PETG).
The third part, the latch, is pushed onto the spindle after it has first been put through the latch hole from the front.

These parts have been printed in PETG using a 0.5mm extruder with a layer height of 0.2mm on a Creality Ender 5 Plus.
External dimensions are accurate, internal dimensions needed to be increased by 0.4mm to allow the 3mm rod to slide easily into the hole without having too much slop.
The rod can be carbon fibre (what I happened to have to hand), a hardwood dowel or modelling plastic would work equally well.
The rod is there for alignment more than strength; the spindle is best printed in two parts due to all the overhangs.
