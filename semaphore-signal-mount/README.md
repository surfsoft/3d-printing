# Semaphore signal mount

Used to mount a semaphore signal (such as the Ratio 469 dual arm semaphore kit) to the baseboard.

The socket is glued in to the baseboard. 
The mount holds the servos (to drive the semaphore arms) and PCB (to control the servos), and the semaphore signal is glued to the top of this.
The overlap of the semaphore signal base beyond the base of the mount stops the mount falling through the socket (this will probably be replaced with a thin lip on two sides instead).
