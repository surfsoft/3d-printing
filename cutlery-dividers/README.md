# Cutlery dividers

This is a set of dividers for a cutlery drawer.
It was designed for a Magnet half width drawer and printed in three parts bas the printer I owned at the time was not big enough to do it on one go.

The two sets of three sections are different sizes, one for shorter cutlery and the other for longer.
Many big sets come with smaller 'starter' cutlery snd larger 'main course' cutlery.
Teaspoons fit in the middle horizontal slot.

I've printed this in PLA and then glued it together and it has lasted well.
As it isn't taking any load you can get away with fewer walls and less infill for quicker printing.

If I were to update the design I would add shallow strips across the bottom and the ends of each section to better keep the overall shape.
