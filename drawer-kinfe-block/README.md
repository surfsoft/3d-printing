# Knife block for a drawer

This is a simple knife block for use is a cutlery drawer.
I wanted something that would separate my sharp knives and stop them rubbing together, which blunts them more quickly.

It has seven slots.
Three are short, four are long.

I originally printed this in PLA and it has lasted well.
It doesn't need particularly thick shells or high percentage infill because it isn't structural.

It could do with a 'handle rest' adding at some point as some of the heavier handled knives don't sit correctly.
Like a keyboard wrist rest.
If I were to update the design I would probably add a slot specifically for my kitchen scissors.
