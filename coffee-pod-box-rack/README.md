# Coffee pod box rack

Designed to take four boxes of Nespresso coffee pods, the box dimensions are approximately:
- 62mm wide
- 65mm deep
- 280mm tall

This is a three part item. The front of the rack contains small lugs separating the box spaces. The rear of the rack
is identical to the front except for the lugs. The bottom runs from front to back, providing support for the boxes as 
they are slid in and out.

The prototype is stuck to the underside of a cabinet with double sided foam, but you could add screw holes into the top 
of each frame instead.

This item was printed in PETG using a 0.5mm hot end and 0.25mm layers at 240/95 degrees on a Creality Ender 5 Plus. 

Although finished and printed, some of the dimensions are not currently defined as variables, making it harder to resize
this item.
