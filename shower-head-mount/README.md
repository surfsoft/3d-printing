# Shower head mount

This is a simple shower head mounting bracket, soemthing that appears to be quite hard to find.

It consists of three parts:
- A backplate
- The bracket
- The 'pin' on which the shower head is placed

The backplate has a pair of screw holes designed for number 8 countersunk screws, 30mm apart.
The bracket is glued to the backplate (use plenty of glue as this takes a lot of load).
The pin is inserted into the hole in the bracket after applying a small amount of glue.
Do not mount, or put any load on the bracket, until everything has had plenty of time to dry.

Because the pin is printed upright it is not, of itself, particularly strong. 
Therefore there is a 3.4mm hole through the middle, into which should be placed a 3mm carbon fibre rod. 
You will need carbon fibre for strength.

This is designed with a 10mm diameter pin and is easily modified for different sizes.
If you resize the bracket width as well, keep at least 8mm overall width in addition to the width of the peg.
Otherwise it will be too weak to take the load and will eventually crack.

I've printed this using PETG on a Creality Ender 5 Plus with the following settings:
- 0.5mm extruder
- 0.2mm layers
- 0.5mm line width
- 0.8mm top and bottom thickness (the bracket should be printed on its side)
- 3 shells for the side walls
- 40% infill for strength

STL files provided are for a 10mm diameter pin.
