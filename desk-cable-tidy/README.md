# Desk tidy system

Note: This is a work in progress.

This is a set of components that make up a modular system for keeping cables and power supplies tidy, organised and out of sight.
It consists of a backplane component, and a collection of organising components designed to hang off the backplane. 
Fix the backplane to the back side of the desk's vanity panel.
The organising components slide on from the end.
They're free to move but can be fixed in place with cyanoacrylate glue.

## The backplane
This is a simple t-shaped item with holes for counter-sunk 4mm screws.
The length is customisable, as is the minimum distance between screw holes.
The design will automatically add the correct number of screw holes based on these parameters.  

## The organising components
The following organising components exist:
- Cable tidy (small, medium and large)
- Velco strap holder (predefined versions for 10mm and 30mm velco widths, but customisable)
